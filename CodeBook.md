==========================

This tidy data set represents the mean of each sensors mean and standard deviation. Below are summarized the variables that were listed in the ```features_info.txt```. A prefix of 't' denotes the time domain (Hz) while the 'f' prefix denotes the frequency domain. The frequency domain was obtained by taking the Fast Fourier Transform on the signals from the Samsung phone.

The set of variables that were omitted in the tidy data:

mad(): Median absolute deviation

max(): Largest value in array

min(): Smallest value in array

sma(): Signal magnitude area

energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values.

iqr(): Interquartile range

entropy(): Signal entropy

arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4

correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals

maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude

meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency

skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal

kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal

bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.

angle(): Angle between to vectors.
